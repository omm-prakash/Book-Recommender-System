            <p>It is a type of recommendation system which works on the principle of popularity and or anything which is
                in trend. These systems check about the books which are in trend or are most popular among
                the users and directly recommend those based on votes and rating.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, if a product is often purchased by most people then the system will get to know that that
                product is most popular so for every new user who just signed it, the system will recommend that product
                to that user also and chances becomes high that the new user will also purchase that.

            <p>It is considered to be one of the very smart recommender systems that work on the similarity between
                different users and also items that are widely used as an e-commerce website and also online movie
                websites. It checks about the taste of similar users and does recommendations.
            </p>
            <p>
                The similarity is not restricted to the taste of the user moreover there can be consideration of
                similarity between different items also. The system will give more efficient recommendations if we have
                a large volume of information about users and items.

            <p class="">
                A Content-Based Recommender works by the data that we take from the user, either explicitly (rating) or
                implicitly (clicking on a link). By the data we create a user profile, which is then used to suggest to
                the user, as the user provides more input or take more actions on the recommendation, the engine becomes
                more accurate.
            </p>
            <p>The goal behind content-based filtering is to classify products with specific keywords, learn what the
                customer likes, look up those terms in the database, and then recommend similar things.
                This type of recommender system is hugely dependent on the inputs provided by users, some common
                examples included Google, Wikipedia, etc. For example, when a user searches for a group of keywords,
                then Google displays all the items consisting of those keywords. The below video explains how a
                content-based recommender works.

            <hr>
            <p class="">
                Recommender systems are used to access appropriate items and information by personalized suggestions
                based on user previous preferences and their likes & dislikes. These systems are used in different
                domains including products, videos, images, articles, news and books. Several recommender systems have
                been designed for recommending books.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, the available book recommenders face several issues in making relevant book recommendations
                because most of these do not take into account the book contents at deeper level and process only the
                mere descriptions about books on web pages along with metadata and other rating information. In order to
                cope with this issue, we present a hybrid book recommender that recommends books by using book table of
                contents (TOC) along with association rule mining and opinions of similar users.
